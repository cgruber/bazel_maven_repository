# Kramer - an archeologist who handled artifacts with care

> "Pots are not people" - Carol Kramer

Kramer is a tool which orchestrates maven artifacts on behalf of Bazel Maven Repository. It is 
designed for use within the maven integration for bazel, and isn't really designed as a standalone
tool. It is a client implementation of Square's [maven-archeologist].
